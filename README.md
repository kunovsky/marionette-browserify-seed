<h1 align="center">Marionette Browserify Seed</h1>

## About
Basically I needed an application that allowed for multiple form modules that may communicate with each other and validation against each other.

## Setup
```shell
npm install
grunt
```

## Build tools
* Browserify generates two bundles - app and vendor
* Light express app for fixure data
